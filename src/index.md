## What Sets Us Apart

### Small Business, Big Results

Sarros Environmental, LLC, is a __small and micro-certified SWaM business in Virginia__ that offers close one-on-one consulting to find solutions to our client’s environmental problems and concerns.  We are a company that, while taking advantage of technological advances when appropriate, appreciate the face-to-face interactions with our clients and the in-person field reviews to problems that require solutions rather than performing desk-top only solutions.

We have managed all environmental aspects of a variety of transportation, construction, development, remediation and restoration projects.

We are known for resourcefulness and creativity in problem solving in addition to remaining flexible and adaptable.  We believe in collecting input from the client and incorporating our client’s concerns into our solutions.  Our approach to environmental compliance is a transparent, open communication approach that allows for negotiation and better relationships with both our client and the regulatory agency or municipality.
